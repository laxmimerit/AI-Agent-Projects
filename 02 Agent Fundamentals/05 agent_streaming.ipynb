      "(ToolMessage(content='[WebSearchResult(content=\\'Advertisement\\\\n\\\\n[SKIP ADVERTISEMENT] \\\\n\\\\nAfter a nearly yearlong delay to its efforts to compete in artificial intelligence, Apple said on Monday that it planned to base its A.I. products on technology developed by Google.\\\\n\\\\nThe upcoming versions of Apple Foundation Models — the company’s models for its A.I. system, Apple Intelligence — will be based on Google’s Gemini A.I. models and its cloud computing services. Those models will power Apple’s personal assistant, Siri, which is commonly used in iPhones and is expected to be upgraded this year, as well as other A.I. features.\\\\n\\\\n“After careful evaluation, Apple determined that Google’s A.I. technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models and is excited about the innovative new experiences it will unlock for Apple users,” the companies said in a statement.\\\\n\\\\nThe companies did not disclose the exact terms of the multiyear deal, and a spokesman for Google said the partnership was not exclusive.\\\\n\\\\nAdvertisement\\\\n\\\\n[SKIP ADVERTISEMENT] \\\\n\\\\nShares of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, ended trading on Monday at just under $332, making it the fourth publicly traded company to be worth more than $4 trillion.\\\\n\\\\nApple has increasingly faced questions over its plans for A.I. The company has largely stayed on the sidelines as other technology juggernauts have spent tens of billions of dollars developing A.I. and as start-ups have pushed the envelope on the technology.\\\\n\\\\nThe partnership with Google does not mean the iPhone maker is abandoning its A.I. work. But it does indicate that Apple is taking a more cautious approach than its peers. It is allowing Google to conduct the laborious — and expensive — development of core A.I. models, which requires the computing capacity of massive data centers running tens of thousands of servers.\\\\n\\\\nThe two companies have a long history of working together. Google has provided the default search engine for Apple’s Safari web browser for years.\\\\n\\\\nApple [stumbled] in its earlier attempts to adopt A.I. In June 2024, the company [demonstrated] Apple Intelligence, which included features like summarizing notifications and improving emails and text messages. Those features arrived later than expected and quickly ran into hiccups. Notification summaries misrepresented news reports, for example, and Apple [disabled that feature].\\\\n\\\\nAdvertisement\\\\n\\\\n[SKIP ADVERTISEMENT] \\\\n\\\\nIn March, Apple postponed the release of an improved Siri. Then, last month, Apple [announced the retirement] of its head of A.I., John Giannandrea. He was succeeded by Amar Subramanya, a former executive at Google and Microsoft.\\\\n\\\\nApple already works with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT with Siri and Apple Intelligence. Consumers can allow Siri to use ChatGPT, for example, to answer more complex questions on behalf of the personal assistant.\\\\n\\\\n[Kalley Huang] is a Times reporter in San Francisco, covering Apple and the technology industry.\\\\n\\\\nA version of this article appears in print on Jan. 13, 2026, Section B, Page 5 of the New York edition with the headline: Apple Bases A.I.
