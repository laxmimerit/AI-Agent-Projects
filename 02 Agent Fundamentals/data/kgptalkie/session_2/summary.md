The user initially requested to load a previous conversation summary, but none was found. Subsequently, the user asked for the latest news on Apple Stock and the current weather in Mumbai. I provided a summary of Apple Stock news from CNBC and Yahoo Finance, including topics like xAI probes, Google's Gemini challenging Apple, AI's impact on software, analyst calls, and Apple's sales job cuts. For Mumbai, I reported the current weather as 31.4°C (88.5°F), overcast, with a real feel of 33.1°C (91.5°F), and wind from the NW at 22 km/h (13.6 mph).
