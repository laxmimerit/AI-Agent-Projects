For a company to succeed in the space, it needs not only an expansive library of great content but also a lot of cash for future content.**Netflix**[(NASDAQ: NFLX)], of course, fits the bill. But so does**Apple**[(NASDAQ: AAPL)]. And Apple also has unique structural advantages: A complementary services business it can bundle with its Apple TV offerings and a more diversified and financially robust business that enables it to take bigger swings on content deals without changing the risk profile of the overall business.\\\\nGiven how established[Apple] \\\\\\'s overall business is, and how its streaming service is just one small portion of a thriving services business, the iPhone maker is arguably one of the few companies in the world that can treat streaming as a long game, not a quarter-to-quarter fight. Even more, I believe that it is finally putting some real weight behind its streaming business. And it\\\\\\'s working.\\\\n***Where to invest $1,000 right now?**Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the**10 best stocks**to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor.[**See the stocks »**] *\\\\nThis is not to say Netflix is in trouble. It is still the category leader, and its business appears to be firing on all cylinders. But Apple has a set of advantages that most[streaming service] rivals do not, and it is starting to use them more visibly.\\\\n![Actors from Apple\\\\\\'s TV show, severance, running down a hall.] \\\\nApple\\\\\\'s TV show Severance was the most-awarded drama at the 2025 Emmy Awards. Image source: Apple.\\\\n## Apple TV\\\\\\'s momentum\\\\nApple\\\\\\'s services business, where Apple TV lies, has morphed into arguably the most important aspect of the investment thesis for Apple stock. The lucrative segment is the company\\\\\\'s biggest growth engine, and it is becoming a larger piece of the overall business over time.\\\\nCapturing its importance to Apple\\\\\\'s broader business, Apple\\\\\\'s services revenue rose about 15% year over year in fiscal Q4 -- an acceleration from about 13% year-over-year growth in fiscal Q3 and faster than the company\\\\\\'s 8% year-over-year growth in total revenue in fiscal Q4. And it is a high-margin business. In fiscal Q4, Apple\\\\\\'s services gross margin was about 75%, compared to about 36% for products. Therefore, when this services segment grows faster than the overall company, it enhances Apple\\\\\\'s overall profit profile over time.\\\\nWithin its services business, Apple TV is now a major player.\\\\nThough Apple does not break out Apple TV\\\\\\'s revenue or subscriber count, it has started to share more engagement-level signals. And they look good.\\\\nIn a January 2026 press release about its services\\\\\\' growth in 2026, Apple said Apple TV \"eclipsed all prior viewership records\" in December 2025. The company also said Apple TV\\\\\\'s total hours viewed in December rose 36% compared to the prior year, setting a record for monthly engagement.\\\\nIn addition to its award-winning content being a driver of growth, several other catalysts are propelling the business higher.\\\\nFirst, Apple has an advantage when it comes to bundling. For instance, it offers a subscription called Apple One, which bundles Apple TV with up to five other Apple services for a lower price than if these subscriptions were paid for separately. This gives Apple TV more distribution, and it gives subscribers more reasons to keep paying.\\\\nThen there are sports. Apple has been aggressively expanding its live sports content. And in October, Apple and Formula 1 announced a five-year partnership that will bring all F1 races exclusively to Apple TV in the U.S. beginning in 2026, including practice, qualifying, sprint sessions, and Grands Prix.\\\\nSports rights, of course, are expensive and competitive. But Apple\\\\\\'s balance sheet gives it enormous financial flexibility. At the end of fiscal 2025, Apple reported about $35.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents, plus about $96.5 billion in marketable securities. Net of its debt, the company\\\\\\'s total cash and cash equivalent position was about $34 billion. In addition, the company generates nearly $100 billion in annual[free cash flow]. This kind of financial firepower likely helps Apple when it comes to its ability to keep investing, experimenting, and bidding for premium content.\\\\n## Netflix still has the home-field advantage\\\\nEven with Apple\\\\\\'s momentum, Netflix remains the standard in streaming. Boasting more than 300 million subscribers and reaching over 190 countries, it has the most recognized streaming brand and global scale. And, more importantly, it\\\\\\'s focused; its business model is built specifically around streaming economics.\\\\nShowing how well the streaming giant is doing,[Netflix] \\\\\\'s third-quarter[revenue] rose 17.2% year over year. And the company\\\\\\'s third-quarter shareholder letter also pointed to multiple notable drivers behind its strong revenue growth, including membership growth, price increases, and increased advertising revenue.\\\\nAdvertising revenue, in particular, is an exciting catalyst for Netflix. While its advertising business is still small since it\\\\\\'s only about three years old, it is growing fast.\\\\n\"We are now on track to more than double our ads revenue in 2025 (still off a relatively small base),\" the company explained in its third-quarter shareholder letter.\\\\nClearly, Netflix is doing just fine.\\\\nStill, investors should keep in mind Apple\\\\\\'s structural advantages, which could make Apple TV a bigger threat over time. Not only does the tech giant have more cash to invest in streaming, but it can also bundle its streaming service with other services. And it can make big strategic moves without significantly altering the company\\\\\\'s overall risk profile.\\\\nUltimately, Netflix has established a lead in streaming that should enable it to continue doing well. But investors should not dismiss Apple TV as a threat -- especially over the long term. It is starting to show measurable engagement momentum, and it sits inside a services engine that still appears to have plenty of runway.\\\\n## Should you buy stock in Netflix right now?\\\\nBefore you buy stock in Netflix, consider this:\\\\nThe*Motley Fool Stock Advisor*analyst team just identified what they believe are the**[10 best stocks] **for investors to buy now… and Netflix wasn’t one of them.

      "Both Apple and Microsoft are major players in the tech industry, each with unique strengths and recent developments. Here's a breakdown to help you consider your options:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Apple (AAPL)**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Strengths:**\n",
      "    *   **Market Leadership:** Maintains a strong position in the tech market.\n",
      "    *   **Services Revenue & Cash Reserves:** Driven by robust services revenue and a substantial cash reserve, providing financial stability.\n",
      "    *   **Vertical Integration & AI Efficiency:** Benefits from its integrated ecosystem and a focus on AI efficiency within its products.\n",
      "    *   **Recent Performance:** Has shown positive returns year-to-date (+11.44%), over one year (+19.84%), and three years (+90.40%), outperforming the S&P 500 in the latter two periods.\n",
      "    *   **Analyst Sentiment:** Generally perceived with bullish sentiment by analysts.\n",
      "*   **Considerations:**\n",
      "    *   **Premium Valuation:** Currently trades at a premium valuation, meaning high expectations may already be priced into the stock.\n",
      "    *   **Sales Job Cuts:** Reportedly cutting sales jobs, which could be a point of concern.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Microsoft (MSFT)**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Strengths:**\n",
      "    *   **AI & Education Advancements:** Continuously strengthening its market position with significant advancements in Artificial Intelligence and educational initiatives.\n",
      "    *   **Diverse Growth Engines:** Benefits from three distinct \"money-printing machines\": Azure (cloud infrastructure, growing at 39%), Productivity and Business Processes (Office, Teams, LinkedIn with high renewal rates), and Consumer and Devices (Windows, Xbox, Surface providing stability).\n",
      "    *   **AI Monetization:** Actively accelerating AI monetization through products like Copilot.\n",
      "    *   **Financial Health:** Possesses a strong balance sheet, high Return on Invested Capital (ROIC), and minimal debt.\n",
      "    *   **Analyst Confidence:** Overwhelmingly bullish sentiment from analysts, with a blended fair value suggesting potential upside.\n",
      "*   **Considerations:**\n",
      "    *   **Regulatory Scrutiny:** Facing scrutiny over pricing practices, including an Italian probe regarding Activision Blizzard mobile games.\n",
      "    *   **AI Sentiment Peak:** Some analyses suggest that the broader AI infrastructure trade sentiment might be nearing a peak, which could impact even strong companies like Microsoft.\n",
      "    *   **Recent Stock Pullback:** Experienced a 15% pullback from its 52-week high, with technical indicators suggesting a sentiment-driven correction. This could be seen as a buying opportunity by some, as it's trading at a reported 19% discount to its fair value.\n",
      "    *   **Potential Risks:** Specific risks identified include potential AI monetization failure, margin compression from AI capital expenditures, regulatory fragmentation, and slower-than-expected Copilot adoption.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary Comparison:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Both companies are tech giants with robust financial standing and a strong focus on AI. Apple offers a more consistently performing, premium-valued investment anchored by its powerful ecosystem and services. Microsoft, on the other hand, presents a more diversified AI-driven growth narrative, particularly through its cloud services. Its recent stock correction might offer a more attractive entry point for investors bullish on its long-term AI strategy, despite some regulatory and sentiment-driven concerns.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The choice between investing in Apple or Microsoft depends on your individual investment goals, risk tolerance, and outlook on their respective growth trajectories. It is crucial to conduct your own thorough research and consider consulting with a qualified financial advisor to determine which investment aligns best with your personal financial situation.\n"
