      "**Comparison Analysis:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Gross Profit Margin:** Google has a higher gross profit margin (56.45%) compared to Apple (46.39%). This suggests that Google retains a larger proportion of revenue after accounting for the cost of revenues, which might be indicative of its software-heavy business model having lower direct costs compared to Apple's hardware-intensive business.\n",
      "*   **Net Profit Margin:** Both companies have very similar and strong net profit margins, with Apple at 26.19% and Google at 25.77%. This indicates that both companies are highly efficient at converting revenue into net income.\n",
      "*   **Return on Assets (ROA):** Apple has a significantly higher ROA (28.47%) than Google (16.29%). This suggests that Apple is more efficient at using its assets to generate profits.\n",
      "*   **Return on Equity (ROE):** Apple's ROE (102.80%) is substantially higher than Google's (22.84%). This extremely high ROE for Apple is largely influenced by its higher debt-to-equity ratio, meaning it uses more debt to finance its assets, which can amplify returns to shareholders. Google, with a lower debt-to-equity ratio, shows a more moderate ROE.\n",
      "*   **Current Ratio:** Google has a healthier current ratio of 1.63 compared to Apple's 0.99. A current ratio above 1.0 generally indicates good short-term liquidity, meaning Google is better positioned to cover its short-term obligations with its current assets. Apple's ratio below 1.0 might suggest tighter short-term liquidity, though for a company of Apple's size and consistent cash flow, this is often managed effectively.\n",
      "*   **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:** Apple has a significantly higher Debt-to-Equity Ratio (2.61) than Google (0.39). This indicates that Apple relies much more heavily on debt financing relative to equity compared to Google. Google, with a much lower ratio, has a more conservative capital structure with less reliance on debt.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Both Apple and Google are financially strong and highly profitable companies. Apple demonstrates superior efficiency in utilizing its assets (higher ROA) and generates exceptionally high returns for its shareholders (very high ROE), partly driven by its leverage. Google, on the other hand, shows stronger gross profitability and better short-term liquidity (higher current ratio) with a more conservative capital structure (lower debt-to-equity ratio). The choice between which company is \"better\" financially depends on the specific metrics an investor prioritizes and their risk tolerance.\n"
