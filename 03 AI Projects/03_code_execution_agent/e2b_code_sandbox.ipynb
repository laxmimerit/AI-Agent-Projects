      "Based on the financial statements for **Apple Inc.** for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, here is the analysis of its financial performance and key ratios:\n",
      "\n",
      "### **1. Liquidity Ratios**\n",
      "These ratios measure Apple's ability to cover its short-term obligations.\n",
      "*   **Current Ratio: 0.87** – Apple's current assets are slightly less than its current liabilities. While a ratio below 1.0 might suggest liquidity pressure, Apple's high cash generation often allows it to operate with a lower current ratio.\n",
      "*   **Quick Ratio: 0.83** – This excludes inventory, showing that Apple relies very little on selling stock to meet short-term needs.\n",
      "*   **Cash Ratio: 0.17** – Approximately 17% of current liabilities can be covered immediately by cash and equivalents.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **2. Profitability Ratios**\n",
      "Apple remains highly profitable with strong margins.\n",
      "*   **Gross Margin: 46.21%** – Indicates a strong ability to manage production costs and premium pricing.\n",
      "*   **Operating Margin: 31.51%** – Shows high efficiency in managing operating expenses (R&D, SG&A).\n",
      "*   **Net Profit Margin: 23.97%** – Apple keeps nearly 24 cents of every dollar of revenue as profit.\n",
      "*   **Return on Assets (ROA): 25.68%** – Exceptional efficiency in generating profit from its asset base.\n",
      "*   **Return on Equity (ROE): 164.59%** – This very high figure is driven by significant share buybacks and a relatively small equity base compared to debt.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **3. Solvency & Leverage Ratios**\n",
      "*   **Debt-to-Equity Ratio: 1.87** – Apple uses significant leverage, with total debt (current and long-term) being 1.87 times its equity.\n",
      "*   **Total Liabilities to Equity: 5.41** – Total liabilities are over 5 times the size of stockholders' equity, reflecting the company's strategy of returning cash to shareholders via buybacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **4. Efficiency Ratios**\n",
      "*   **Asset Turnover: 1.07** – Apple generates $1.07 in revenue for every $1.00 of assets.\n",
      "*   **Inventory Turnover: 28.87** – Apple turns over its inventory nearly 29 times a year, indicating highly efficient supply chain management.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **5. Cash Flow Analysis**\n",
      "*   **Free Cash Flow Margin: 27.83%** – A significant portion of revenue ($108.8 billion) is converted into free cash flow, which supports dividends and the aggressive share repurchase program.\n",

      "3.  **Cash Conversion:** Even though Google earns more Net Income, **Apple** remains the \"Cash King.\" Apple converts 27.8% of its revenue into Free Cash Flow, whereas Google converts 20.8%, primarily because Google is currently in a heavy investment cycle for AI infrastructure.\n",
      "4.  **Shareholder Value:** Apple's staggering **164.6% ROE** is a result of its strategy to minimize equity through massive share buybacks, whereas Google maintains a much larger equity buffer.\n"

      "#### **Efficiency (ROA & ROE)**\n",
      "*   **Asset Efficiency:** Apple leads in **ROA (25.7%)**, indicating it generates more profit for every dollar of assets owned compared to Google (22.2%).\n",
      "*   **Equity Efficiency:** Apple's **ROE (164.6%)** is exceptionally high compared to Google's **30.8%**. This massive discrepancy is driven by Apple's capital structure; Apple uses significant debt and aggressive share buybacks to reduce its equity base, which mathematically inflates ROE.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Liquidity (Current Ratio)**\n",
      "*   **Google** is in a much stronger liquidity position with a **Current Ratio of 1.84**, meaning it has nearly double the current assets needed to cover its short-term obligations.\n",
      "*   **Apple’s Current Ratio (0.87)** is below 1.0, which typically indicates a potential liquidity risk. However, for a company like Apple with massive reliable cash flows, this often reflects \"just-in-time\" cash management and high efficiency in managing working capital rather than actual financial distress.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Leverage (Debt-to-Equity)**\n",
      "*   **Google** is extremely conservative with a **Debt-to-Equity ratio of 0.03**, signifying almost no reliance on long-term debt relative to its massive equity.\n",
      "*   **Apple** is more aggressively leveraged with a ratio of **1.87**. Apple deliberately uses debt to fund operations and return capital to shareholders (dividends and buybacks), taking advantage of its strong credit rating to optimize its cost of capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Conclusion**\n",
      "In 2024, **Google** stands out for its **profitability margins and rock-solid balance sheet liquidity**. Meanwhile, **Apple** demonstrates **superior asset efficiency and aggressive financial engineering** (high leverage and ROE) to maximize shareholder returns, despite carrying higher debt and tighter liquidity margins.\n"

      "*   This was primarily driven by **$52,535,000,000 USD** in Capital Expenditures (Purchase of PPE) and **$2,931,000,000 USD** for Acquisitions (Purchase of Business).\n",

      "*   **Debt (Minimal Impact):** While Alphabet issued **$13,589,000,000 USD** in new long-term debt, it also paid down **$12,701,000,000 USD** of existing debt. The resulting net debt issuance of **$888,000,000 USD** was negligible relative to their total investment needs.\n",
      "*   **Cash Reserves:** Alphabet did not need to dip into its cash reserves to fund investments. In fact, its cash position remained relatively stable, starting the year at **$24,048,000,000 USD** and ending at **$23,466,000,000 USD**.\n",
